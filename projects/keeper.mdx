 *Keeper*

* React
* JSX
* CSS

In this project I learned how to use React, a Javascript framework. I learned about components, 
how to use hooks such as useState and props. I also use mapping, React froms, and ES6 Template Literals. 
This app is similar to Googles keep app. A user can add and delete notes with titles.

 *Unsplash API Gallery*

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* REST API 

In this project I built an image browser that lets you search for freely usable images from Unsplash. 
I used a RESTful API to fetch images from Unsplash's API. After fetching the thirty images from Unsplash, 
the user can favorite and unfavorite certain images by clicking the heart icon on each image. The user can 
also view their favoirted images on a seperate page. The favorited images are saved even after the page is refreshed.
